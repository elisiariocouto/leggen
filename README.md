# üí≤ leggen

An Open Banking CLI.

This tool aims to provide a simple way to connect to banks using the GoCardless Open Banking API.

Having a simple CLI tool to connect to banks and list transactions can be very useful for developers and companies that need to access bank data.

Having your bank data in a database, gives you the power to backup, analyze and create reports with your data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies
  - Python: for the CLI
  - [GoCardless Open Banking API](https://developer.gocardless.com/bank-account-data/overview): for connecting to banks
  - [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/): for storing transactions, good balance between performance and query capabilities
  - [Ofelia](https://github.com/mcuadros/ofelia): for scheduling regular syncs with the database when using Docker

## ‚ú® Features
  - Connect to banks using GoCardless Open Banking API
  - List all connected banks and their status
  - List balances of all connected accounts
  - List transactions for an account
  - Sync all transactions with a MongoDB database

## üöÄ Installation and Configuration

In order to use `leggen`, you need to create a GoCardless account. GoCardless is a service that provides access to Open Banking APIs. You can create an account at https://gocardless.com/bank-account-data/.

After creating an account and getting your API keys, the best way is to use the [compose file](docker-compose.yml). Open the file and adapt it to your needs. Then run the following command:

```bash
$ docker compose up -d
```

The leggen container will exit, this is expected. Now you can run the following command to create the configuration file:

```bash
$ docker compose run leggen init
```

Now you need to connect your bank accounts. Run the following command and follow the instructions:

```bash
$ docker compose run leggen bank add
```

To sync all transactions with the database, run the following command:

```bash
$ docker compose run leggen sync
```
